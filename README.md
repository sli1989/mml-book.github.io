# Mathematics For Machine Learning

Companion webpage to the book "[Mathematics For Machine Learning](https://mml-book.com)". 

Copyright 2018 by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal,
and Cheng Soon Ong. To be published by Cambridge University Press.

We are in the process of writing a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.

We split the book into two parts:

* Mathematical foundations
* Example machine learning algorithms that use the mathematical foundations

We aim to keep this book fairly short (around 400 pages), so we don't cover everything.
